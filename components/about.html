                <p>
                    I'm an enthusiastic developer with hands-on experience in mobile app development using 
                    React Native and Swift. My background in computer science, combined with practical 
                    project experience, has given me strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

                    Currently transitioning my skills to web development, I bring a unique perspective with 
                    my mobile development experience. I understand responsive design, component-based 
                    architecture, and modern development practices. My experience with React Native 
                    translates well to React web development.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about creating intuitive user experiences and writing clean, maintainable 
                    code. I thrive in collaborative environments and am excited to contribute to innovative 
                    web projects in a remote or hybrid setting.
